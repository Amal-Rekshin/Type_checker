Below is the SQL equivalent for the operations you listed. Each command performs similar operations as in Hive but is written in SQL.

---

### 1. *UPDATE*
In SQL, you can update records in a table using the UPDATE statement.

sql
UPDATE students
SET grade = 'A'
WHERE marks > 90;


### 2. *EXPORT*
In SQL, "exporting" is typically done by selecting data and writing it to an external file or table. Here is an example:

sql
SELECT * FROM students
INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/exported_file.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';


---

### 3. *IMPORT*
In SQL, importing data is often done using the LOAD DATA statement.

sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/import_file.csv'
INTO TABLE students
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';


---

### 4. *SORT BY*
To sort data in SQL, you can use the ORDER BY clause.

sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC;


---

### 5. *DISTRIBUTE BY*
In SQL, you can achieve distribution using partitioning. Here's an example:

sql
SELECT *, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY marks DESC) AS distribution
FROM students;


---

### 6. *CLUSTER BY*
In SQL, clustering can be simulated by combining PARTITION BY and ORDER BY. 

sql
SELECT * 
FROM students
ORDER BY subject, marks;

### Execute the Commands
Since I cannot directly execute SQL here, you can run the above commands in a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-based tool. Let me know which platform you're using, and I can guide you on how to execute these!
